# Java OOPs – Employee Management System (Day 1)
🚀 This is part of my 10-Day Java Developer Challenge to showcase core concepts using real-world examples.

## 📌 Day 1 Focus: Object-Oriented Programming in Java
 ✅ **Encapsulation**: Securing data with private fields and public getters/setters.
 ✅ **Inheritance**: FullTime and PartTime employees inherit from a common Employee class.
 ✅ **Polymorphism**: Overriding `calculateSalary()` in subclasses and calling via base class reference.
 ✅ **Abstraction** *(Bonus)*: Interface or abstract class used for generic behavior.
